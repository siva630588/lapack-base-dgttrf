## Introduction

Tridiagonal matrices arise frequently in numerical methods, particularly in solving differential equations and discretized systems. The LU factorization of such matrices is a powerful technique for solving linear systems efficiently. This repository implements the DGTTRF subroutine from LAPACK, allowing you to perform LU factorization on tridiagonal matrices.

The primary focus of this repository is to provide a straightforward and efficient solution for users who need to work with tridiagonal matrices in their applications. By utilizing this implementation, you can streamline your computations and enhance the performance of your algorithms.

## Installation

To install the LAPACK Base DGTTRF library, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siva630588/lapack-base-dgttrf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lapack-base-dgttrf
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This will set up the library in your local environment, making it ready for use in your projects.

## Usage

To use the LAPACK Base DGTTRF library, you can import it into your JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to perform LU factorization on a tridiagonal matrix:

```javascript
const { dgttrf } = require('lapack-base-dgttrf');

const n = 5; // Size of the matrix
const d = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; // Diagonal elements
const e = [1, 1, 1, 1]; // Sub-diagonal elements
const f = [1, 1, 1, 1]; // Super-diagonal elements

const [lu, piv] = dgttrf(n, d, e, f);
console.log('LU Factorization:', lu);
console.log('Pivot Indices:', piv);
```

This code snippet shows how to import the `dgttrf` function and use it to compute the LU factorization of a tridiagonal matrix. 

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic LU Factorization

Consider a simple tridiagonal matrix:

```
| 4  1  0  0  0 |
| 1  5  1  0  0 |
| 0  1  6  1  0 |
| 0  0  1  7  1 |
| 0  0  0  1  8 |
```

You can represent this matrix using the following arrays:

```javascript
const n = 5;
const d = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; // Diagonal
const e = [1, 1, 1, 1];     // Sub-diagonal
const f = [1, 1, 1, 1];     // Super-diagonal

const [lu, piv] = dgttrf(n, d, e, f);
console.log('LU Factorization:', lu);
console.log('Pivot Indices:', piv);
```

### Example 2: Advanced Usage with Custom Data

You can also use custom data for more complex matrices. For instance, if you have specific values for your tridiagonal matrix, simply adjust the `d`, `e`, and `f` arrays accordingly.

```javascript
const n = 4;
const d = [10, 20, 30, 40];
const e = [2, 3, 4];
const f = [1, 2, 3];

const [lu, piv] = dgttrf(n, d, e, f);
console.log('LU Factorization:', lu);
console.log('Pivot Indices:', piv);
```
